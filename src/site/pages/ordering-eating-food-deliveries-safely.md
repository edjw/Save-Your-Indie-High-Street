You may be worried about ordering food during the coronavirus.

This is a summary of advice on receiving and eating orders of food from restaurants safely. It is from [a BBC article about the safety of home food deliveries](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-52040138).

The Food Standards Agency says, "there is no reason to avoid having ready-to-eat food delivered if it has been prepared and handled properly".

1. Order from reputable chains or good restaurant kitchens.

2. Empty the food out of its packaging into a clean dish. Put the packaging in the bin. Wash your hands before you eat.

3. Use cutlery to take food out of its container. Do not use your fingers to take food out of its container.

4. Order hot, freshly-cooked food. Do not order cold or raw items.

5. For the most cautious and vulnerable, microwave your food for a couple of minutes.
